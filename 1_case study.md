# Case Study: University Information System

## Objective
The objective of this case study is to understand the practical application of **databases**, **data marts**, and **data lakes** in managing diverse data needs of a large university.

---

## Scenario
Imagine that you are part of a data management team at a large university. The university manages a variety of data types related to students, faculty, research projects, and administration. The university is looking to optimize how it stores, accesses, and analyzes this data to improve decision-making and operational efficiency.

## Data Storage Needs
1. **Student Information Management**:
   - **Data Type**: Structured data (e.g., student IDs, course enrollments, grades)
   - **System**: The university uses a **database** to manage daily operations related to students, such as registering for classes and recording grades.

2. **Departmental Reporting**:
   - **Data Type**: Aggregated and summarized data
   - **System**: A **data mart** is used to provide reports for specific departments, like the School of Engineering, allowing them to analyze student performance and course enrollment trends without accessing the entire data warehouse.

3. **Research Data Storage**:
   - **Data Type**: Structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data (e.g., research papers, datasets from experiments, lab results)
   - **System**: A **data lake** is used to store raw research data in various formats, enabling future analysis and data exploration by researchers.

## Discussion Questions
1. **Database Usage**: What advantages does a database provide for managing structured student records compared to other storage systems?
2. **Data Mart Application**: How does a data mart improve efficiency for department-specific reporting, and what are some potential limitations?
3. **Data Lake Benefits**: Discuss why a data lake is suitable for storing diverse research data and the challenges that may come with managing and analyzing this unstructured data.
