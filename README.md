# Big Data Course Materials

This repository contains the materials for a **Big Data** course. The content is designed for undergraduate and graduate students and covers a range of topics related to big data concepts, technologies, and hands-on practice using tools like Apache Spark and Databricks.

## Overview

The course focuses on the following areas:

- Basic concepts and definitions related to Big Data, such as databases, data lakes, data marts, and more.
- Introduction and comparison of SQL and No-SQL databases, with an emphasis on key-value and column-family No-SQL databases.
- Recap of the 5 V's of Big Data (Volume, Velocity, Variety, Veracity, and Value).
- Traditional vs. Big Data processing approaches, including top-down and bottom-up methodologies.
- An in-depth exploration of Big Data technologies such as Apache Hadoop, MapReduce, and Apache Spark.
- Practical exercises in Apache Spark using Databricks, covering topics like filtering, transformations, joins, aggregations, window functions, and working with both DataFrames and RDDs.

## Requirements

To run the code examples and exercises provided in this repository, you will need the following:

1. **Databricks Account**: You can sign up for a free Databricks community account [here](https://databricks.com/).
2. **Python**: Most examples in the course are written in Python using Spark's Python API (PySpark).

## Topics Covered

- **Big Data Basics**: Foundational concepts of data storage, types of data, and how big data differs from traditional data systems.
- **SQL vs. No-SQL**: Comparison of relational databases and No-SQL databases, with a focus on key-value and columnar No-SQL solutions.
- **Big Data Technologies**: Overview of Hadoop, MapReduce, and Spark, including real-world use cases and advantages.
- **Hands-on Practice with Spark**: Step-by-step instructions for running basic and advanced operations in Spark, using Databricks as the primary platform.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
